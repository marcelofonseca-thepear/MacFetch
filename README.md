# # Only to be used on terminals. A bunch of the main features were taken from Hwinfo lib. [![Lib](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/lfreist/hwinfo)

Build:

- create a temporary enviroment path:
  ```sh
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(pwd)/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
  ```

- execute .sh:
  ```sh
  sh build.sh
  ```

- or

  ```sh
  bash build.sh
  ```
### and done!

The code is very rubbish, it will be fixed in the future(but who knows when).
